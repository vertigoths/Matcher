# Matcher
• It's a game that once you select a tile, all the same colored tiles that are either horizontally or vertically connected get replaced with randomly colored tile.
# Tried to demonstrate
• Observer pattern

• MVC Architecture in Unity
# What can be added?
• Randomly generating initial map
• Checking for minimum tile match to process
• Swapping tiles
